    for (j in 1:ncol(x))

    }

    outlier.vec <- vector(length=nrow(x))

- Typed out and ran the provided code but did not receive any errors.
- Checked the code multiple times to ensure that no mistakes were made, but everything was entered correctly.
- Can't provide data to test as I do not know what the function tukey.outlier() is supposed to do exactly. It has to obviously do with finding outliers in the dataset, but I can't be sure what its output will be.
- Maybe just because RStudio does not return an error does not mean that there isn't a bug in the code. If there is one then I am currently unable to find it or am not knowledgeable to understand what is going wrong with the code.
